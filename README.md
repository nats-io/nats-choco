# NATS Chocolatey Packaging

These are utilities to build [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) packages for NATS windows executables.  Chocolatey NuGet is a Machine Package Manager, somewhat like apt-get, but built with Windows in mind.

## Requirements
In order to build NATS chocolatey packages the following requirements must be met:

* A windows machine with powershell v2 or greater.  Most windows systems default to this.
* [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) must be installed and on the path.

## How it works
At install time the specified package will download the corresponding zip file from the github nats.io release packages, then extract and place the contents where chocolatey requires them to be.  This method (versus including binaries) simplifies the moderation process with Chocolatey, and ensures proper binaries are always downloaded.

### NATS Server (gnatsd) Package

Instructions:

1. `chdir` to the `gnatsd` direcory.
2. Inspect/Edit the `gnatsd.nuspec` and `tools\ChocolateyInstall.ps1` to ensure the correct version numbers and checksums are set.
3. `build_package` creates the package as a `<gnatsd>.<version>.<packagefix>.nupkg` file .
4. `test_package` and inspect output for errors.
4. Upload the package to Chocolatey and begin the moderation process.
 
### NATS Streaming Server (nats-streaming-server) Package

Instructions:

1. `chdir` to the `nats-streaming-server` direcory.
2. Inspect/Edit the `nats-streaming-server.nuspec` and `tools\ChocolateyInstall.ps1` to ensure the correct version numbers and checksums are set.
3. `build_package` creates the package as a `<nats-streaming-server>.<version>.<packagefix>.nupkg` file .
4. `test_package` and inspect output for errors.
4. Upload the package to Chocolatey and begin the moderation process.

## Package Names and Versioning

Use a version of `<package>.<release-version>.YYYYMMDD` with a date, e.g `gnatsd.0.9.4.20160818`.  It is the Chocolatey standard that allows one to fix/modify the package without a product version bump.

## TODO

- [ ] Automate versioning - accept version as a script parameter and generate nuspec files from a template
- [X] NATS Streaming Server chocolatey package
